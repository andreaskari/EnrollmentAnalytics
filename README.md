## Project Details

A potential application for this data collection and analysis is that we could create an app that would notify people when lectures they wanted had fluctuations in enrollment. This app would make the whole process of Tele-BEARS easier for people with the app, and those who were trying to switch sections would be able to do so, sneaking into the class before people on the waitlist even had a chance at it. If this app were reliable enough, weâ€™re confident that many UC Berkeley students would pay for it, considering the importance people place with getting the right professor and the best section times.
